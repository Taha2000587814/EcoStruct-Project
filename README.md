# EcoStruct-Project
Project Name: EcoStruct Building a Sustainable Future
Team
Taha A. Kreem : Project Manager - Lead Developer 

Technologies
Unity Engine: For game development.
C#: Primary programming language.
Blender: For 3D modelling.
Git: Version control system.
Alternatives considered for Unity were Unreal Engine, which offers high-fidelity graphics but requires more resources. C# was chosen over Java for its seamless integration with Unity.

Challenge
Problem: The lack of engaging educational games in civil engineering. Non-Solution: This project will not address non-educational gaming markets. Users: Civil engineering students and professionals. Locale Relevance: While globally applicable, initial focus will be on educational institutions in Sudan.

Risks
Technical Risks: Integration of real-world engineering data; mitigated by consulting industry experts. 
Non-Technical Risks: Market acceptance; addressed through targeted marketing strategies.

Infrastructure
Branching: GitHub Flow strategy.
Deployment: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
Data Population: Use of mock data transitioning to real user data post-launch.
Testing: Automated testing with Unity Test Tools.

Existing Solutions
SimCity: Similar in city-building, lacks educational focus.
Civilization VI: Strategy-based, not tailored for civil engineering education.
Transform coding was chosen for its efficiency in image compression, over other methods like Fractal compression, due to its balance between quality and compression ratio.
